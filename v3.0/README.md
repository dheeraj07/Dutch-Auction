Dutch Auction Smart Contract - Version 3

1. Create a new contract called NFTDutchAuction_ERC20Bids.sol. It should have the same functionality as NFTDutchAuction.sol but accepts only ERC20 bids instead of Ether. The constructor for the NFTDutchAuction_ERC20Bids.sol should be: constructor(address erc20TokenAddress, address erc721TokenAddress, uint256 _nftTokenId, uint256 _reservePrice, uint256 _numBlocksAuctionOpen, uint256 _offerPriceDecrement)
2. Write test cases to thoroughly test your contracts. Generate a Solidity coverage report and commit it to your repository under this versionâ€™s directory.
