Dutch Auction Smart Contract - Version 2

1. Create a new contract called NFTDutchAuction.sol. It should have the same functionality as BasicDutchAuction.sol but it sells an NFT instead of a physical item. The constructor for the NFTDutchAuction.sol should be: constructor(address erc721TokenAddress, uint256 _nftTokenId, uint256 _reservePrice, uint256 _numBlocksAuctionOpen, uint256 _offerPriceDecrement)
2. Write test cases to thoroughly test your contracts. Generate a Solidity coverage report and commit it to your repository under this versionâ€™s directory.
